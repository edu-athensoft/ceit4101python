"""
Write a program that takes a year as input and determines whether it is a leap year or not. If the year is a leap year, output "It is a leap year", otherwise output "It is not a leap year".
The rules for determining a leap year are:
Years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100 are leap years;
Years that are divisible by 400 are also leap years.

Use nested if statements to implement the program.
